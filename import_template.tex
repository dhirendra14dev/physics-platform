\begin{question}
    \type{MCQ_SINGLE}
    \chapter{KINEMATICS_1D}
    \difficulty{EASY}
    \text{A car starts from rest and accelerates at $2 \text{ m/s}^2$. What is its velocity after 5 seconds?}
    \option{A}{5 m/s}
    \option{B}{10 m/s}
    \option{C}{15 m/s}
    \option{D}{20 m/s}
    \answer{B}
    \solution{Using $v = u + at$: $v = 0 + (2)(5) = 10 \text{ m/s}$.}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
    \type{ASSERTION_REASON}
    \chapter{NEWTONS_LAWS}
    \difficulty{MODERATE}
    \assertion{Plastics impact animals and the environment.}
    \reason{Many animals consume plastic as a food and eat it by accident.}
    \option{1}{Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.}
    \option{2}{Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A.}
    \option{3}{A is true but R is false.}
    \option{4}{Both A and R are false.}
    \answer{1}
    \solution{Plastics are non-biodegradable and animals often mistake them for food, leading to ingestion and ecosystem damage.}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
    \type{NUMERICAL}
    \chapter{ELECTROSTATICS}
    \difficulty{DIFFICULT}
    \text{Calculate the force between two charges of 1C each separated by 1m in vacuum. (Use $k = 9 \times 10^9$)}
    \answer{9.0e9}
    \solution{Using Coulomb's Law: $F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} = 9 \times 10^9 \cdot \frac{1 \cdot 1}{1^2} = 9 \times 10^9 \text{ N}$.}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
    \type{MATRIX}
    \chapter{HEAT_THERMODYNAMICS}
    \difficulty{MODERATE}
    \text{Match the thermodynamic processes in List-I with their characteristics in List-II.}
    \row{A}{Isothermal}
    \row{B}{Adiabatic}
    \row{C}{Isobaric}
    \row{D}{Isochoric}
    \col{p}{$\Delta Q = \Delta W$}
    \col{q}{$dQ = 0$}
    \col{r}{$dP = 0$}
    \col{s}{$dV = 0$}
    \answer{(A)-p, (B)-q, (C)-r, (D)-s}
    \solution{Basic definitions of thermodynamic processes.}
\end{question}
