\text{Column-I indicated certain situations and column-II indicates the values of electric field (induced or electrostatic). Match the correct options :}
\row{A}{A uniformly charged infinite cylinder of radius $R$. $x$ is distance from axis of cylinder}
\row{B}{Current flowing through uniform cylindrical resistor. x is distance from left end. x is less than the length of resistor.\includegraphics{t1.png}}
\row{C}{An ideal solenoid f radius R. Current through solenoid is increasing with time. x is distance from axis of solenoid. \includegraphics{t2.png}}
\row{D}{A conducting rod of length $\ell$ is moving in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field with uniform velocity. x is distance from upper end. $(\mathrm{x}<\ell)$, \includegraphics{t3.png}}
\col{p}{$\mathrm{E}=0$}
\col{q}{$|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}|$ increases with increase in x , reaches a maximum and then decreases.}
\col{r}{$|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}|$ decreases with increase in x , reaches a minimum and then increas.}
\col{s}{$|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}|$ is constant}
\col{t}{$|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}|$ continuously decreases with increase in x}
